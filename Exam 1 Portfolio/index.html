		<div class="Facts"> <p>I currently work as a Printer Technician for Marco Technologies. I service printers and copiers for the company and make sure that the machines that are
		contracted through us are working well. Southeast Tech is in our contract, so you may see me working on a printer somehwere around campus! I am married and have one son that
		enjoy spending time with when I am not working.</p>
