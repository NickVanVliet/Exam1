	<h1>Personal Introduction</h1>
	<h2>Hello, my name is Nicholas Van Vliet!</h2>
	<body>
		<p>My favorite culture that I am not related to would be Alaskan, I just came back from vacation there and loved the sense of community and ability to thrive in the gorgeous landscapes and mountains.</p>
		<p>Two historical figures that I relate to would be Abraham Lincoln for his honesty and Nikola Tesla for tinkering and experimenting alone in his laboratory because I enjoy tinkering away from distractions.</p>
		<p>A meal that represents me would be a cheeseburger, because it is a well balanced meal.</p>
		<p>I feel most creative when I am alone in my office working on my computer or hanging out with my wife and son.</p>
